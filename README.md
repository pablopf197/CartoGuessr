# **Cartoguessr -  A game that makes learning geography exciting**

**Cartoguessr** is an engaging and interactive geography game built with **React** and powered by **Vite**. It challenges players to test and improve their knowledge of countries, flags, and capitals through 3 exciting game modes.

### 🎮 Game Modes:
1. **Countries Mode**  
    Challenge your geography skills with three different playstyles:
   - **Normal Mode**: Choose a number of countries and locate them on an interactive 3D map powered by **Mapbox**. The map will highlight selected countries in red or green, depending on whether your choice is correct.
   - **Chrono Mode**: Race against the clock to find as many countries as possible within 1 minute.
   - **Solution Mode**: Not a game mode per se—explore the full world map with all countries and cities marked, allowing you to learn at your own pace without time pressure.
  
2. **Flags Mode**  
   Test your flag recognition by selecting the correct country from 4 options based on the displayed flag.
   
3. **Capitals Mode**  
   Put your capital cities knowledge to the test by choosing the correct capital of a given country from 4 cities.

- The project is bootstrapped with **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** for fast and optimized development.
- Currently, the project does not include backend functionality. User data is stored locally, and progress is not persistent. Refreshing the page will reset your scores.

### 🚀 Future Updates:

- Mobile optimization to enhance gameplay on smaller screens.
- Additional game modes and features for an enhanced learning experience.
